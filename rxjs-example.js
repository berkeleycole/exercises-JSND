// Browsers won't run RxJS code on their own, but thankfully RxJS created a tool called the RxJS playground! 
// Take the code below and paste it into https://rxjs-playground.github.io/#/ to see it running


// A function runs once and returns one set of information
// An observable is like a function that runs for a persiod of time and can return many sets of information - a stream of information

const observable = new Rx.Observable(subscriber => {
  subscriber.next(1);
  subscriber.next(2); // "return" another value
  subscriber.next(3); // "return" another value
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next(4);
    subscriber.complete();
  }, 1000);
});
 
console.log('just before subscribe');

observable.subscribe({
  next(x) { console.log('got value ' + x); },
  error(err) { console.error('something wrong occurred: ' + err); },
  complete() { console.log('done'); }
});

console.log('just after subscribe');

// the word 'next' is a special RxJS observable word that allows the observable to "return" multiple things over a period of time


// There are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:

// "Next" notification: sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.
// "Error" notification: sends a JavaScript Error or exception.
// "Complete" notification: does not send a value.

// "Next" notifications are the most important and most common type: they represent actual data being delivered to a subscriber. 
// "Error" and "Complete" notifications may happen only once during the Observable Execution, and there can only be either one of them.
